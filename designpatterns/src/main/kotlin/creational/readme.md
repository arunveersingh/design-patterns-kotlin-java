Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. 
The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design.
Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling this object process.


Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas 
--
1. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
2. Hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

Creational design patterns are further categorized into 
--

1. Object-creational patterns 
2. Class-creational patterns

Object-creational patterns deal with Object creation and Class-creational patterns deal with Class-instantiation. In greater details, Object-creational patterns defer part of its object creation to another object, while Class-creational patterns defer its object creation to subclasses.
