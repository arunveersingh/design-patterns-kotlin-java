Behavioral Design Pattern
--
[Excerpt from Wikipedia]

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Creational Design Pattern

[Excerpt from Wikipedia]

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Structural Design Pattern

In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

In much simpler words, structural design patterns how classes and objects are composed to make bigger structures.
